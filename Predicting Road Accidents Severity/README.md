# Predicting Road Accidents Severity

### Description
According to World Health Organization 1.19 M people dies every year because of road accidents. This number not only include adult but kids and young adults of age between 5-29. Road accidents is one of the major causes of unnatural deaths. To our surprise the rate for unnatural death is increasing every year.
As part of this project, I chose the dataset from Addis Ababa Sub-city police departments. Using this analysis, we will predict the road accidents severity.


### Tools/Technologies Used
numpy, seaborn, pyplot, train_test_split, RandomForestClassifier, Decision Tree, classification_report, confusion_matrix, DecisionTreeClassifier

### Methodology
Data Preparation: Cleaned and organized dataset is from Addis Ababa Sub-city police departments. This dataset contained the records of road accidents happened between 2017 to 2020, handling missing values and balancing of the training dataset is done.
Supervised learning algorithm Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms are used.

### Results
The two-model decision tree and random forest were trained to performed prediction, but
Decision Tree show the accuracy of 98%% and came out as best model in this project scenario.
