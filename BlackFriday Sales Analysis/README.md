Customers prepare list of expensive item electronics, furniture and others and plan to buy them during Black Friday at low prices whereas retailers look forward to this day to increase their sales, clear inventory and to add new customers.

### Tools/Technologies Used
Nifi, HDFS, Hive, HBase, Spark

### Objective:
The objective of Black Friday sales data Analysis project is to understand the customer behavior. This analysis will help the retailers to understand their customer and can come up with list of optimize inventory and improve marketing strategies to increase their sales and attract more customers. To achieve the goal of the project my plan is to utilize big data analytics on Black Friday Sales data to gather important information about the customer and can help business to develop strategies to meet customer need , provide better services and increase revenue for the retailers.

### Results:
The overall documentation shows that each component plays an important role in providing highly scalable and flexible system which can easily handles the growing need of retailers in handling the increase volume of data or managing the dataset efficiently. We have successfully ingested data into HDFS from GitHub, as next step we able to define table schema in Hive and were able to load data into the table. Once the data loaded into the hive table, we were able to analyze the data using HiveQL. In order to perform the advanced data manipulation and transformation we used PySpark. Spark runs multiple algorithm or rule-based checks in processing layers to see if data form any pattern and send it downstream for further analysis. The recognizing of the patterns will help us to understand customer behavior to know if there is any product which are in demand, or we can learn about customer interest and make changes to the inventory or plan strategies to those customers.
Using the components, we were able to get lots of useful information about the customer. We analyze different set of queries result to get the valuable insight of the black Friday dataset.
