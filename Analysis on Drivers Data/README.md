### Problem and Goal
Purpose of analyzing the driver’s data to find out Which states has the worst drivers in United States? Is number of accidents and premium are related to each other? I have studied How the premiums getting effected by increase rate of accidents? Which state has high and low premium in United States? Apart from that I have also added the region information in our data set to see which region in United States has worst drivers.

### Tools and Methodology Used
Dplyr, ggplot2, hist, ggplot, Rmd

### Conclusion
I have analyzed driver_fatalities, insurance_premiums and insurance_companies_losses, region variables of data set. Along with that I have visualized the data to see the number of car crashes in each state, the insurance premiums in each state, fatal collision in each region, Relationship between Car Insurance Premiums
and fatal collision, how much insurance company pay out? speeding percent in each region and lastly the drivers with alcohol percent in all regions. After learning about all we can conclude that we have good drivers in Idaho as its Car Insurance premium is low , also the losses incurred by Insurance company is also low
14 compare to all other state. On the other hand, North Dakota, South Carolina, New jersey, and Louisiana states have worst drivers in United State. Overall, we can say that South region has the worst drivers in United States.
