# Predicting Diabetes in Patients

### Description
Diabetes is a metabolic disease which can results in serious health issue if proper precaution not taken. It causes high blood sugar which can affect the hormone insulin of patient body. Hormone insulin helps body in moving the sugar from the blood to body cells and make sure it stored as energy. As part of the first project, I chose the dataset of medical science field. Using this analysis, we will predict if patient has diabetes or not.

### Tools/Technologies Used
numpy, seaborn, pyplot, train_test_split, RandomForestClassifier, classification_report, confusion_matrix, DecisionTreeClassifier

### Methodology
Data Preparation: Cleaned and organized diabetes datasets National institutes of Diabetes, Digestive and kidney diseases, handling missing values and Scaling of the training dataset is done.
Supervised learning algorithm Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms are used.

### Results
The two-model decision tree and random forest were trained to performed prediction, but
random forest show the accuracy of 77% and came out as best model in this project scenario.
