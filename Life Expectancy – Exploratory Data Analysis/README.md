# Life Expectancy â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis
### Description
Life expectancy means the number of years a person is expected to live based on the statistical average. There is certain variable on which life expectancy depends based on some research. As part this project, I am exploring some of these variables to see the correlation between them and to understand how much these variables effect the life expectancy. These data information is from World Health Organization.

### Tools/Technologies Used
thinkstats2, thinkplot, pyplot

### Variables that could have helped

I tried to find relationship between life expectancy at birth with variables BMI, Measles and Polio. I think I was more focused on these variables if I have spent some time with variable GDP, I would have found strong relationship between the GDP and life expectancy at birth.
Also, I have not used variable life expectancy at age 60 as its distribution is random and do not have normal or skewed distribution.

### Assumption in project

I assumed there would be a strong relationship of life expectancy at birth with variables BMI, Measles and Polio but to my surprise I could see only week relationship while visualizing I have noticed that distribution did not follow well defined pattern.

### Challenges

There were few challenges that I want to discuss.
This is my first time working with life expectancy data. Although the topic was interesting, but I wish I have more information for the same. As I spent lot of time in understanding columns and its definition.
The second challenge is when we have to compare two scenarios using a PMF. To decide the column and how I want to divide the data to create two scenarios, I have spent lot of time. Later I have chosen year column and created scenarios for year <= 2003 and year > 2003.

### Results
After performing statistical process, I can say that Life expectancy has statistically significant relationship with variables like BMI, Measles, Polio and GDP. Although I found the correlation is week.
